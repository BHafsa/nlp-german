# Stanford CoreNLP

[Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) provides a rich set of state-of-the-art NLP tools. It can be use via command line interface, a Java API, or a web API. To use CoreNLP from programming languages other than Java it is recommended to use the CoreNLP server with its web API.

# CoreNLP Server

The [CoreNLP server](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html) offers a simple web-based interface and a web API.

## Setting up the CoreNLP Server

Running the CoreNLP server with support for German requires downloading the base CoreNLP package and the German language models.

The official [CoreNLP server documentation](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html) describes all necessary steps to setup and run the server.
However, to make things easier, we'll use a docker image which includes all required libraries and models.

### Docker Image

The [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/motiz88/corenlp/) is outdated (last update end of 2015) and does not support German. Hence, we build our own.

*Build docker image:*

```sh
docker build -t corenlp-german .
```

*Run docker image:*

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name corenlp corenlp-german
```

Once the CoreNLP server is running it can be accessed via http://localhost:9000.

## CoreNLP Python Wrappers

There is a list of python wrappers on the CoreNLP homepage. Following wrapper have been tested.

### [stanfordcorenlp](https://github.com/Lynten/stanford-corenlp) by Lynten

:heavy_check_mark: Easy to use with some nice helper functions for pos-tags, ner, etc.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Response of annotate() returns raw json text without parsing. Each call to a helper function sends a new request.

_Install:_
```sh
pip install stanfordcorenlp
```
_Basic Usage:_
```python
from stanfordcorenlp import StanfordCoreNLP
nlp = StanfordCoreNLP('http://localhost', port=9000)
print(nlp.annotate('Köln is a city in Germany.'))
```

### [py-corenlp](https://github.com/smilli/py-corenlp) by Smitha Milli

:heavy_check_mark: Small and easy to use wrapper.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Unicode only works with Python 3. Has not been updated since 2016. (Probably does not support the latest updates of CoreNLP with TokenRegex).

_Install:_
```sh
pip install pycorenlp
```
_Basic Usage:_
```python
from pycorenlp import StanfordCoreNLP
nlp = StanfordCoreNLP('http://localhost:9000/')
print(nlp.annotate('Köln is a city in Germany.'))
```

### [stanford-corenlp](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp) by Arun Chaganty

:x: Throws Protobuf Exception, was not able to set json format! (tested with Python 3)

_Install:_
```sh
pip install stanford-corenlp
```
_Basic Usage:_
```python
from corenlp import CoreNLPClient
nlp = CoreNLPClient(start_server=False, endpoint='http://localhost:9000/')
print(nlp.annotate('Köln is a city in Germany.'))
```

### [stanford-corenlp](https://github.com/hhsecond/corenlp_pywrap) by Sherin Thomas

:x: Bad implementation. Unicode is broken. Annotators have to be set with constructor. Response object has to be processed manually. Only works with Python 3.

_Install:_
```sh
pip install corenlp_pywrap
```
_Basic Usage:_
```python
from corenlp_pywrap import pywrap
nlp = pywrap.CoreNLP(url='http://localhost:9000', annotator_list='tokenize ssplit pos'.split())
print(nlp.basic(u'Köln is a city in Germany.', out_format='json').json())
```

## Using the CoreNLP Server

### Selecting Text with TokensRegex

[TokensRegex](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokensregex.html) can be used to evaluate regular expressions over text and tokens.

* *Example 1*: Matching measures of thinks, e.g. '15 minutes', as two consecutive tokens, 1st with cardinality type and 2nd is a noun.
        [{pos:CARD}][{pos:NN}]
